2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 inst_lcd_master/seq_cntr_reg_rep has an input control pin inst_lcd_master/seq_cntr_reg_rep/ENARDEN (net: inst_lcd_master/seq_cntr_reg_rep_i_1_n_0) which is driven by a register (inst_lcd_master/inst_i2cm/busy_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port ja[3] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port jb[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port jb[3] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>

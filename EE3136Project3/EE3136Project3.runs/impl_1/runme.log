WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 inst_lcd_master/seq_cntr_reg_rep has an input control pin inst_lcd_master/seq_cntr_reg_rep/ENARDEN (net: inst_lcd_master/seq_cntr_reg_rep_i_1_n_0) which is driven by a register (inst_lcd_master/inst_i2cm/busy_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.101 ns between inst_i2c/inst_i2cm/data_rd_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and inst_ClockGen/counter_reg[28]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.101 ns between inst_i2c/inst_i2cm/data_rd_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and inst_ClockGen/counter_reg[29]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.101 ns between inst_i2c/inst_i2cm/data_rd_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and inst_ClockGen/counter_reg[30]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
